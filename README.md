# Adventure-Works-DB

This repository contains the SQL script of processing of Microsoft Adventure Works database. The database contains various relational tables.
The database can be accessed from the below URL : https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/adventure-works/data-warehouse-install-script

I have also included snapshot of database schema for reference.
Please note, I have used Microsoft SQL Server for processing this database. If you are using any other DB engine, some queries might differ.
